On [starvault.nicostern.de](https://starvault.nicostern.de) I continuously update Obsidian templates and structural ideas on how to elevate Obsidian to an intelligent, automated knowledge vault using a node.js-based Quartz server instance for show casing.

Since I learned to love Obsidian's `.md` only(*) approach combined with the *infinite* possibilities provided by the comunity through plugings (view my own: [Todoian](nicostern.de/p/todoian/)), Obsidian became my smart journal, habit tracker, project manager and overall second brain - 'cause remember:

Main content in StarVault:
- `smart templates` adapting to note titles and thus making Obsidian a structured, linked place (using Templater)
- `naming, prefix, tagging and yaml conventions` I gathered throughout years of evelating my Obsidian usage combining many and many of tutorials
- thinking in Obsidian
