On [obsidian.nicostern.de](https://obsidian.nicostern.de) I plan to develop a subset of my private Obsidian Vault using a Quartz server.

Since I am impressed by it's .md approach combined with the *infinite* possibilities provided by the comunity through plugings, Obsidian became my smart journal, habit tracker, project manager and overall second brain - 'cause remember:

> **"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."** \

The main content I plan to incorporate includes:
- some of the modules at [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de) that I have been tutoring, like:
  - Technical Computer Science (de: "Technische Informatik")
  - Internship In Object-oriented Software Development (de: "Praktikum objektorientierte Softwareentwicklung")
- Scientific based learning techniques
