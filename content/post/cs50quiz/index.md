After passing my A-levels, I missed working on projects and having coding targets. Therefore, I prepared for my Bachelor in Computer Science at [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de) by completing the HarvardX Course "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science" - look at my cool [certificate](https://certificates.cs50.io/b5e8b380-b3c8-4426-88a7-f10bac14d69d.pdf?size=letter). CS50 Quiz appears to be my self-chosen final project which I describe like so:

Using the knowledge gained througout the ten weeks of CS50x, this Swift code for iOS devices (tested on iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 16) builds a Single Choice QuizApp. The questions are fetched and parsed as .json from a Firestore Database. The project is connected to a Firebase via SDK packages (particulary FireAuth). Since Swift is not covered in the CS50x input, I made use of several online tutorials, eg. for Firebase or .json parsing.
